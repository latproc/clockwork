These examples are a bit of a test to see how hard it is to use
clockwork for everyday problems. The 'everyday' problems come from
the 2021 Advent of code (https://adventofcode.com).

The data files for the examples aren't included here because they
aren't my work. Please have a look through the adventofcode site if
you want to try these.

Solving these with clockwork isn't trivial. The examples here
are fairly advanced use of the tools and not for the feint hearted.

At the time of writing, clockwork doesn't have the FILESTREAM or READER 
machines so reading data is done by directing it into netcat; on macos:

    nc -l 10001 -k <input.txt

this data is read by the device connector, running in another terminal:

    ./device_connector --host localhost --port 10001\
           --pattern '.*' --name data --queue queue \
            --client -- channel DeviceConnector --no_timeout_disconnect

clockwork itelf can run the examples here using something like:

    ../../iod/cw ../stdchannels.cw ./puzzle1.cw

It's handy (and fun) to have the sampler (see https://github.com/latproc/scope)
running in another window to watch the internals and
observe how the calculations work.

Some of the examples output a result in a LOG message but some need you
to connect using iosh (../../iod/iosh) and SEND analyzer.calculate or
similar to see the result.

Enjoy.
