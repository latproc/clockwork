Instructions

* pull the latproc project from git

  git clone..

* extract the etherlab kit to the same location

  tar xjf etherlab-bundle-...
  
configure and build etherlabs ethercat component

  cd etherlab-bundle.../ethercat-...
  ./configure --enable-generic --enable-e1000e=no --enable-8139too=no
  make

  (your configure options may be different from ours)

create a build directory for a local build of the etherlab bits we need.

  mkdir tool
  cd tool
  EL=../etherlab-bundle-1.10/ethercat-1.5.1 \
  CFLAGS="-I$EL/include -I$EL/master -I$EL/tool" ../createmake $EL/tool
  make
  
change to the latproc directory and make a symbolic link that points to
the ethercat master and tools from the etherlab kit

  cd latproc
  ln -s ../../etherlab-bundle-1.10/ethercat-1.5.1/ ethercat

build the latproc tools

  make
