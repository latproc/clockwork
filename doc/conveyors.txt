Analogue Conveyor Ramp Control

This document describes the control of conveyors 
using clockwork to set ramps for startup and shutdown 
and to monitor the conveyors for proximity to stop positions.

Our interface uses a set or properties that the conveyor
control algorithm uses in its control steps.

The basic state machine:

Conveyor MACHINE {
    stopped STATE;  # not moving
    moving STATE;   # moving, potentially controlling speed
    stopping STATE; # aiming to stop at a position
}



To stop a conveyor, 

* send a stop command
* send a halt command (to be removed)
* set a stop position (conveyor will attempt to stop at that position)
* change the set point for the conveyor to zero

To start a conveyor,

* change its stop position 
* send a start command (this changes the set point)



NOTES

conveyors use position input values from analogue or digital counter inputs
in the case of analogue inputs in particular, noise can cause 
a conveyor to think it's moving when it isn't.  A single bit error
on input will cause a velocity estimate followed immediately by its
opposite.

The speed for these to transitions will be the same as long as the 
timing is identical for both transitions. Irregularities in timing
of sensor reads will cause differences in the estimated speed.
