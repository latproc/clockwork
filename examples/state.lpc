# This machine tests the use of automatic (so-called 'stable') states
# with passive states. It will move from state to state on receipt of
# commands A, B or C because of the transition table.  
#
# Note that when the property = 'last' becomes 'b' the machine 
# automatically transitions to state x. Since x is not 
# referenced in the transition table, there is no way for
# the machine to leave that state.
